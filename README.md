# DailyReturns

This web app allows users to calculate and visualize the daily returns of an investment over a period of 30 days. The user inputs the starting amount and the growth rate (in percentage), and the app dynamically generates three tables, each presenting different aspects of the investment:

1. **Starting Amount**: This table displays the initial investment amount for each day (1-30).
2. **Daily Return**: This table shows the return earned on each day (1-30) based on the growth rate provided by the user.
3. **Total Return and Final Amount**: This table presents the cumulative total return and the final amount at the end of each day (1-30).

The tables are split into three columns, corresponding to the three aspects mentioned above. The app utilizes Bootstrap for responsive design and provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to explore the daily growth of their investment. Additionally, a fade-in animation is applied to each table row, enhancing the visual appeal of the app.
